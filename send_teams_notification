# This code will connect to a Teams endpoint and send a notification to a channel. 
# You will need to set the endpoint and token variables to your Teams endpoint and authorization token. 
# You will also need to create a file named token.txt and save your authorization token in the file.

# Import the Teams PowerShell module
Import-Module MicrosoftTeams

# Get the Teams endpoint and authorization token
$endpoint = "https://outlook.office.com/api/v2.0/"
$token = Get-Content -Path "C:\path\to\token.txt"

# Create a Teams client
$client = New-Object Microsoft.Teams.Client($endpoint, $token)

# Send a notification to a channel
$client.Conversations.PostMessage(
  @{
    ChannelId = "#general"
    Text = "This is a notification from PowerShell!"
  }
)
